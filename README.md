Alexander, R.B., 2019. *No Convincing Evidence That Antarctic Ice Sheet is Melting.* [online] Available at: <https://www.scienceunderattack.com/blog/2019/10/21/no-convincing-evidence-that-antarctic-ice-sheet-is-melting-37> [Accessed 24 October 2021].<dr/>

The main claim suggested by the article is that the calving of large icebergs is a natural process that has no relation to global warming and does not have a significant effect on sea level. The primary evidence used to support this claim is a 2015 NASA study reporting that the Antarctic ice sheet was gaining rather than losing ice in 2008, and that ice thickening was making sea levels fall by 0.23 mm per year.

Interestingly, the author acknowledges the existence of global warming and the possibility that a retreating ice shelf could contribute to sea level rise, but emphasizes that the current breakups of Antarctic ice shelves are adding no more than about 0.1mm to global sea levels per year; he cites the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the source of this information. The author also includes a figure (1) by NOAA that indicates significant temperature rise between 1958 to 2012 in West Antarctica and states that it is unsurprising that there is so much concern over the imminent collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet.

The final message that the author leaves with the reader is that climate models are not a good representations of reality and that the global panic over the meltdown of Antarctica is unwarranted.

This article is particularly interesting because it does not deny global warming, nor does it try to hide information that directly refutes its claims. For instance, the article includes findings from the Fifth Assessment report of the UN’s IPCC that the Antarctic ice sheet was shedding mass and causing sea levels to rise by 0.41 mm per year between 2005 and 2010. The article also highlights that the 2015 NASA study and the Fifth Assessment report of IPCC are both based on the same method of modelling sea levels – satellite altimetry – despite their findings being contradictory. I believe the holistic approach that the article takes when discussing the issue of the Antarctic ice sheet makes their claims much more compelling than the claims of articles that are entirely one-sided or very clearly biased.

The article was published in 2019 by Ralph B. Alexander, a retired physicist and science writer. He received his PhD in physics from the University of Oxford, and his thesis focused on the interdisciplinary area of ion-solid interactions. Although this article is relatively recent and appears to be written by someone with some credibility, it is published to the author’s personal website “Science Under Attack” and has not undergone any type of review; thus, the source does not seem reputable.

Upon conducting more research into the claims made by this article, it became evident that they were not well supported. It is generally believed that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is a significant indicator of climate change and driver in sea-level rise (The IMBIE team, 2018). Additionally, satellite observations and modelling indicate that the Antarctic Ice Sheet has lost 2720 +/- 1390 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2017, which corresponds to an increase in mean sea level of 7.6 +/- 3.9 millimetres (The IMBIE team, 2018). Although the NASA study that the article uses to support its claim that the Antarctic ice sheet is thickening appears credible, the idea that the calving of large icebergs has no relation to global warming and does not have a significant effect on sea level is not reflected in the NASA study nor any other credible literature.
